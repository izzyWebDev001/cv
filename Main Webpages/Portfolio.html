    <p><em>Isabelle (Izzy) Spencer</em></p>
    <p>The following webpage contains art pieces (both traditional and digital) compiled together for the purpose
    of applying to universities and jobs. The contents will be changed over the years as I develop as
    an artist. The name of each piece is listed alongside it, along with the series it belongs to,
    the theme(s) behind it, and when it was made.</p>
